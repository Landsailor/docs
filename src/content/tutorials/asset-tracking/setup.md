# Asset Tracker Setup


## Create a product

All Asset Tracker devices are intended to be used in a product, not as developer devices. This makes it easy to manage a fleet of asset trackers, allowing per-fleet and per-device configuration settings, and features like fleet mapping. 

It's OK if you're starting out with a single Tracker; you can create a free prototyping level product that only has one device in it. From the [console](https://console.particle.io), click on the **Products** icon (1) then **New Product** (2).

When you create the product, be sure to select **Asset Tracker (Cellular** as the type.
