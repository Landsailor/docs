# IoT Rules Engine


The Particle Rules Engine is an **IF**/**THEN** workflow builder specifically
designed for IoT data. It lets anyone on your team easily create conditional
business logic using a visual interface.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/intro.png" class="full-width"/>

The Rules Engine can trigger activities in the cloud based on something
that is happening in a device's environment. That is:

**IF** certain conditions are met in the _physical world_, **THEN** take an
action in the _digital world_.

Some of the specific ways you could use the Rules Engine in this way include:
- Notify a device owner when sensor readings leave a healthy
range
- Open a new case in your CRM of choice when a hardware component stops
functioning
- Alert your on-call engineers when the error rate of your fleet exceeds
a certain threshold

The opposite goal can also be achieved:

**IF** certain conditions are met in the _digital world_, **THEN** take
an action in the _physical world_.

Some of the specific ways you could use the Rules Engine in this way include:

- Send an over-the-air firmware update to a device when it has been
added to a [device group](/tutorials/product-tools/device-groups/)
- Activate certain features of your product when customer payment
information is collected
- Disable access to using a broken device when a serviceperson is
en-route to fix it

The Rules Engine is a Particle-integrated, professional-grade deployment of a popular
tool called [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/). Node-RED not only provides
a robust flow-based programming framework, but also access to a
variety of open-source contributions to the project made by its thriving
community of IoT builders.

## Key Terms
There are some key terms that will help you get started with the Rules
Engine:

### Nodes
<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/node.png" class="small"/>

The building blocks of the Rules Engine are called **nodes**. Each node
represents a distinct piece of logic and has a well-defined purpose:
it gets some data, does something with that data, and then passes that data on.

There are many different types of nodes that carry out specific
functions. Each node can be configured with pre-defined properties to
work to your specifications.

There are 3 main types of nodes:
- **Input nodes** that inject data into a flow. These nodes are placed
at the beginning of a flow and trigger flow execution.
- **Output nodes** that send data out of a flow. These nodes are place
at the end of a flow.
- **Processing nodes** that receive data from the previous node, execute
some logic, then send the result onto the next node. These nodes are
place in the middle of a flow.

### Flows

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/flow.png"/>

Multiple nodes are connected to one another, creating networks called **flows**.
The flow is responsible for moving data between the nodes.

If nodes are the building blocks of the Rules Engine, flows are the
end-products. They represent the combination of many pieces of logic
into an end-to-end workflow.

### Palette

The "menu" of available nodes available to you when assembling flows is
known as a **palette**. From the palette, you can drag nodes onto the
workspace and incorporate them into a flow.

The Rules Engine comes standard with a default set of nodes that caters
to the most common use cases. However, there are many available nodes
that do not come with the default palette that may be useful to you.
Learn more in the section on [adding nodes to your
palette](#adding-nodes-to-your-palette).

### Message

The Rules Engine executes a flow by passing **messages** from node to
node. These messages are simple objects that always have an ID, and
often also have a set of associated properties.

In the Rules Engine, a message object is normally referred to as `msg`.
Associated properties are most commonly stored in `msg.payload`.

## Getting Started
Let's get you up and running with the Rules Engine.

To apply for beta access to the Rules Engine, please visit [https://www.particle.io/iot-rules-engine](https://www.particle.io/iot-rules-engine). Once accepted, you should get an email with your Rules Engine instance URL. The
URL should look something like `https://myname.rules.particle.io`.

When visiting your Rules Engine instance, you will first be asked to log
in with your Particle account. Only approved members of your team will
be given access to your Rules Engine.

After successfully logging in, you will be taken to the Rules Engine
workspace.
<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/rules-engine-default.png"
class="full-width"/>

On the left, you'll see the [palette](#palette) of nodes available to
you. Nodes in the palette are categorized, and can be filtered using the
search box above the palette pane.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll notice an info pane that
can provide you with context and instructions as you build flows. By
default, you will see metadata on the flow you're currently working on,
including its name and ID. The right pane can also be toggled from
_info_ to _debug_, which can provide helpful debugging information.

The majority of the screen is dedicated to your flow-builder.
Drag-and-drop any node onto the grid to incorporate it into a flow. Your
flow is given a default name of "Flow 1." Double-click the tab at the
top of the flow builder to rename it at any time. You can also click on
the **+** button in the top-right corner of the flow builder to create
new flows.

### Hello World Flow

We can start with the simplest flow possible: injecting some data in,
and logging it out using the debug node.

First, find the **inject node** in your palette on the left pane. The
inject node does what you would expect â€” injects a message to initiate
a flow. The message can take on different flavors, like a piece of
text, a number, a timestamp, or a more complex structured data object.

Drag the inject node onto your flow builder grid. You should see the
right pane change to include information about the inject node.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/inject-node.png"
class="full-width"/>
<p class="caption">Click and drag the inject node onto the grid
to add it to your flow</p>

By default, the inject node will initiate a flow with a timestamp. Double
click on the inject node to customize its behavior. Let's inject the
current time at an interval of every 5 seconds as shown below:

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/inject-node-config.png" />

Click **Done** to save the node and return to the flow builder. Nice!
You've added your first node. You'll notice that the inject node has a
blue dot in the top-right corner. This means that there have been
changes to this node that need to be deployed (more on that later).

Next, find the green **debug node** and drag that onto the grid. Note
the node connectors on the right edge of the inject node, and the left edge
of the debug node. Connect the inject node to the debug node by drawing
a line from one node connector to the other with your mouse. This is the
method by which you connect nodes to one another to allow them to pass
data through the flow.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/first-flow.png" />
<p class="caption">Nodes are connected to one another to pass data
through the flow</p>

In order to the flow to begin running, you must **deploy** it. Deploying
the flow saves any pending changes and begins processing inbound
messages. Whenever there are pending changes, the deploy button will
illuminate in the nav bar.

Click the deploy button to get our Hello World flow up and running:

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/deploy-button.png"
class="full-width"/>
<p class="caption">Deploy flows to begin processing messages and pick up
on any pending changes</p>

You should receive notification that your flow has been successfully
deployed. In addition, the blue dots have disappeared, suggesting the
pending changes have been deployed.

At the top of the right pane, click on the **debug tab**. Voila! You
should see a new up-to-date timestamp added to the debug logs every 5
seconds.

<img src="/assets/images/rules-engine/debug-tab.png" />

At any time, you can click on the trash can icon to clear the debug log.
You can also filter the logs to all nodes, selected nodes, or the
current flow.

Note that the debug pane is actually logging `msg.payload`. The
timestamp is being attached to the `payload` key of the message
object. This method of accessing properties of a message using
`msg.[property]` is a very common nomenclature in the Rules Engine.

Congrats! You've built your first flow successfully.

## Adding Nodes to Your Palette

Beyond the nodes included with the default palette, you have the ability
to install a variety of open-source nodes that have been contributed to
Node-RED by the community.

There are thousands of community-contributed nodes and flows that
extend the capability of the Rules Engine. Many of these nodes provide
integrations with 3rd-party tools and services.

To explore the library of open-source nodes available to you, click on
&nbsp;<i class="ion-navicon-round"></i> > **Settings** in the top nav bar.

From here, click **Palette**, then the **Install** tab. You now can
search the library of nodes to find the one that suits your needs:

![](/assets/images/rules-engine/expand-palette.png)

When you find the node you're looking for, click the **install** button
to add it to your palette. You will need to confirm this action.
