# The Particle Leak Detection Kit 


## Getting started with leak detection
Water might be the source of all life, but it can also be the source of a lot of discomfort if it gets to places it shouldn’t. A flooded basement, mold growth, damaged floors and ceilings, are all expensive problems that can result from leaks.

In the Particle Leak Detection Kit, you'll learn how to build a local network that distributes the tasks of alerting and monitoring between three different devices. You'll first create a small Particle Mesh network using the Particle Argon and two Xenons. The Argon will function as the gateway of the mesh network and facilitate communication from other mesh devices — like the two Xenons — as well as connect to the Particle Device Cloud. 

Low-power, cheap, and Mesh-capable Xenons will be used with water sensors to detect the presence of water. They will then relay that information to a Wi-Fi connected Argon which will act as a communication and notification hub. Thanks to the ease of use of the Grove system, this should be a simple and quick project, even if you’re just starting out.
