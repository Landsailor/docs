# Tracker Edge Firmware API Reference

One difference between the Tracker One and other Particle devices is that the Tracker One firmware can be used in three different ways:

- Completely off-the-shelf. With its cloud-based configuration, you can use the firmware as-is with no modifications in some cases.
- Semi-custom. The Tracker One firmware is customizable on-device making it possible to add new sensors and customize behavior while still making it easy to upgrade the base firmware.
- Custom. The Tracker One firmware is open-source so you can duplicate and modify it ("fork") for completely custom applications. Or build your own completely from scratch.

This reference guide describes the API for use with semi-custom and custom device firmware.
